# Day 15 - Implement Chain-of-Thought

Welcome to Day 15 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've covered the fundamentals and various aspects of using examples. Now, we move into techniques that delve deeper into the AI's processing. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is a powerful method to make the AI's reasoning explicit, which can lead to more accurate results and provide valuable intermediate steps for your content.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile's new flagship phone boasts a display with a high refresh rate. Instead of just saying "high refresh rate means smoother scrolling," the marketing team wants a more detailed explanation of why it's smoother and how that benefits the user. Your challenge is to use CoT prompting to get the AI to provide this step-by-step reasoning.

### Task:

Write a prompt that uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to explain the benefit of a high refresh rate screen on a smartphone. Instruct the AI to think step-by-step about how a high refresh rate impacts the display and user experience before stating the final benefit.

## Solution (Right Side Content)
Great job! By implementing Chain-of-Thought prompting, you've successfully encouraged the AI to reveal its reasoning process. This technique is invaluable for generating explanatory content and debugging why an AI might arrive at a particular conclusion. Get prepared for Day 16!

### Example Prompt:

Explain the benefit of a high refresh rate screen on a smartphone. Think step by step about how a high refresh rate impacts the display and user experience before stating the final benefit.

### Example Output:

Okay, let's think step by step.

1. A standard smartphone screen refreshes its image, say, 60 times per second (60Hz). A high refresh rate screen refreshes much faster, maybe 90, 120, or even more times per second.

2. This faster refresh rate means the image on the screen is updated more frequently.

3. When you scroll through content or play games, the visuals change rapidly. With a faster update, the transitions between images are smoother and appear less choppy.

4. This leads to a more fluid and responsive visual experience when interacting with the phone.

**Therefore, the benefit of a high refresh rate screen is significantly smoother scrolling, more fluid animations, and a more responsive feel when gaming or navigating the interface.**

This example demonstrates how the instruction to "Think step by step" prompted the AI to break down the explanation into logical steps. It started with the basic definition (refresh rate), explained the consequence of a higher rate (more frequent updates), described the visual effect (smoother transitions), and finally summarized the user benefit (smoother scrolling, fluid experience). This step-by-step output provides much richer content than a simple one-sentence answer and can be used to build more detailed marketing copy or educational materials for NextMobile customers.
