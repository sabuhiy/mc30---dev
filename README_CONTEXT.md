# MC30 Challenge Database - Context Files

## 🎯 How to Use These Files in New Conversations

### For YOU (Human):
1. **Start new conversations** by sharing `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with the AI
2. **For complex topics**, also share `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
3. **Update `CONVERSATION_LOG.md`** after each session with key discoveries
4. **Keep files updated** as the project evolves

### For AI Assistants:
When starting a new conversation about this project, the human should share one or more of these files to give you instant context about:
- Database structure and relationships
- Established patterns and solutions
- Previous conversation outcomes
- Common tasks and query templates

## 📂 Context File Structure

```
├── README_CONTEXT.md     ← This file (explains how to use context files)
├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md    ← Essential info for instant context
├── PROJECT_CONTEXT.md    ← Comprehensive project documentation  
└── CONVERSATION_LOG.md   ← Track discussions and decisions
```

## 🔄 Workflow for New Conversations

### Quick Task (5 minutes):
1. Share `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with AI
2. Ask specific question
3. Get immediate help with established patterns

### Complex Work (30+ minutes):
1. Share `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` AND `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. Reference relevant sections from `CONVERSATION_LOG.md`
3. Work on complex problems with full context
4. Update `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` with new discoveries

### Project Status Updates:
1. Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with new structures/patterns
2. Add session summary to `CONVERSATION_LOG.md`
3. Update `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with new common patterns

## 💡 Example Conversation Starters

**For Quick Tasks:**
> "I'm working on the MC30 challenge database project. Here's my quick reference: [attach QUICK_REFERENCE.md]. I need to update Day 15's description field."

**For Complex Work:**
> "I'm continuing work on the MC30 challenge database. Here's the project context: [attach PROJECT_CONTEXT.md] and recent conversations: [attach CONVERSATION_LOG.md]. I need to implement bulk updates for challenges 10-20."

**For New Team Members:**
> "Here's the complete context for our MC30 database project: [attach all files]. Can you help me understand the current update patterns?"

## 🛠 Maintenance Tips

- **Update files immediately** after discovering new patterns
- **Keep QUICK_REFERENCE.md concise** - it should fit in one screen
- **Use PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for detailed documentation**
- **Log all significant discoveries** in CONVERSATION_LOG.md
- **Version control these files** if working in a team
