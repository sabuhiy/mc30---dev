Subject: Day 17: Divide and Conquer

Pre-header: Learn to break complex tasks into manageable steps for better AI performance.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 17 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

Yesterday you learned Chain of Thought prompting to show step-by-step reasoning for complex calculations. Today, we explore task decomposition - breaking complex tasks into smaller, focused subtasks that produce higher quality results and make the process more manageable.

NextMobile's content marketing team needs to create a comprehensive competitive analysis comparing their services against three major competitors across multiple categories - pricing, speed, coverage, customer service, and features. When they ask the AI to do this all at once, the output is overwhelming and lacks the depth needed for strategic decision-making. The team wants to learn how to break this complex analysis into manageable pieces that produce thorough, actionable insights they can use to improve their competitive positioning.

Let's master the art of task decomposition!

Best, Sab

### Challenge Detail
Yesterday you learned Chain of Thought prompting to show step-by-step reasoning for complex calculations. Today, we explore task decomposition - breaking complex tasks into smaller, focused subtasks that produce higher quality results and make the process more manageable.

### Task
Break down NextMobile's competitive analysis into smaller, focused tasks. Create a sequence of prompts that builds a comprehensive competitive analysis piece by piece.

### Solution (Right Side Content)
Task Decomposition is incredibly powerful - it transforms overwhelming competitive analysis into focused, actionable insights that drive strategic marketing decisions and competitive positioning improvements.

Here's how Task Decomposition works:

**Example Prompt #1:**
Compare NextMobile's pricing against Competitor A, B, and C for residential plans. Focus on value proposition and identify pricing advantages.

**Example Output #1:**
**Pricing Analysis: NextMobile vs. Competitors**
- NextMobile Essential ($49): 25% below market average
- Competitor A Basic ($65): Higher price, lower speeds
- Competitive advantage: Superior value at entry level

This focused pricing analysis reveals NextMobile's clear value proposition and pricing advantages, making it easier to identify specific talking points for sales conversations.

**Example Prompt #2:**
Analyze speed offerings across all competitors. Identify NextMobile's technical advantages and areas for improvement.

**Example Output #2:**
**Speed Comparison Analysis**
- NextMobile Fiber: Up to 1Gbps (industry-leading)
- Competitor A: Max 400Mbps (outdated infrastructure)
- Strategic advantage: Future-ready technology

The speed analysis highlights NextMobile's technological superiority and identifies specific competitive advantages that can be emphasized in marketing materials.

**Example Prompt #3:**
Compare coverage maps and expansion plans. Identify market opportunities and competitive threats.

**Example Output #3:**
**Coverage Analysis**
- NextMobile: 85% metro coverage, aggressive suburban expansion
- Competitor B: 95% metro but limited rural presence
- Opportunity: Rural market penetration

This coverage assessment reveals strategic opportunities and helps NextMobile focus expansion efforts where competitors are weakest.

**Key Insight:**
Task decomposition transforms overwhelming competitive analysis into focused, actionable insights that drive strategic marketing decisions and competitive positioning improvements by breaking complex analysis into manageable, specific components.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Break NextMobile's competitive analysis into 3-5 focused subtasks
2. Create sequential prompts that build on each other for comprehensive analysis
3. Test individual components before combining into final strategic recommendations

**Common Pitfalls ❌ :**
**Making subtasks too broad or complex**: Defeats the purpose of decomposition
**Creating too many tiny tasks that lose context**: Fragments the analysis unnecessarily

**Pro Tips ✅ :**
**Start with high-level structure, then break down**: Ensures logical flow and coverage
**Each subtask should have a clear, specific goal**: Maintains focus and quality
**Test subtasks independently before combining**: Ensures each component works well
