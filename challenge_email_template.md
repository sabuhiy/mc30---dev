## Content Guidelines

### Subject Lines
- **Day 0**: Use "Prompt30 - Your AI Journey Starts Now!"
- **Days 1-9**: Use "Day 1Ô∏è‚É£: [Challenge Title]" format
- **Days 10-30**: Use "Day 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£: [Challenge Title]" format (with proper emoji numbers)
- Always include the challenge title after the day number and colon
- Keep subject lines under 60 characters when possible

### Preheader Text
- Each email must include a relevant preheader (85-100 characters recommended)
- The preheader should summarize the day's challenge or highlight the key learning
- Place the preheader as visible text (not a comment) inside the `<mj-raw>` block at the top of the email body
- Example: `Understand prompting vs. prompt engineering for better results!`

### Intro Paragraphs (Single Paragraph)
Each intro paragraph should:
- Reference what was learned yesterday (if applicable)
- Introduce today's concept in simple terms
- Connect to the business value
- Be 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use these alternative patterns to vary the intro for each day, always referencing the day number and learning progression. Make sure randomly select one pattern and do not repeate the same back-to-back:
- - Yesterday, in Day [N-1], you learned about [yesterday‚Äôs topic]. Today, in Day [N], we‚Äôll [today‚Äôs topic].
- - Welcome to Day [N]! Yesterday‚Äôs challenge focused on [yesterday‚Äôs topic]; today, you‚Äôll build on that by [today‚Äôs topic].
- - You completed Day [N-1]‚Äîgreat work! Today, in Day [N], we‚Äôll tackle [today‚Äôs topic].
- - As you finish Day [N-1], get ready for Day [N]: [today‚Äôs topic].
- - Day [N] is here! Building on what you learned in Day [N-1], today‚Äôs focus is [today‚Äôs topic].

- Keep the NextMobile business context
- Maintain the specific task requirements

### CTA Button Text
Based on the challenge_urls.csv, use these button texts randomly:
- "Ready to start?"
- "Begin Challenge"
- "Start Learning"
- "Get Started"
- "Begin Now"
- "Start Challenge"
- "Begin Capstone"

### Tomorrow's Preview Lines
Each email should end with a single sentence that:

- Creates anticipation for the next challenge
- Shows the learning progression
- Varies by day to maintain interest

## Implementation Notes

1. **URLs**: Use the exact URLs from challenge_urls.csv for each day
2. **Challenge Descriptions**: Copy directly from the corresponding prompt30-day-[n].md file
3. **Consistency**: Maintain NextMobile branding and business context throughout
4. **Progression**: Each intro should reference the previous day's learning when applicable
5. **Anticipation**: Tomorrow previews should create excitement for the next challenge 

## Important Workflow Note

- **Always update only the `.mjml` files for email content.**
- **Never update `.html` files directly.** These are generated automatically from the `.mjml` source files.
- All edits, corrections, and new content for emails should be made in the `.mjml` files only.
- **Always populate the preheader in the `.mjml` file for each email.** Never leave the preheader as a placeholder; it should be a relevant summary or highlight for the day's challenge.
