Subject: Day 9: Guide AI with Few-Shot Prompting for NextMobile

Pre-header: Leverage the power of a few examples in your prompts in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 9 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will learn about Few-Shot Prompting, a practical application of In-Context Learning (ICL). This technique involves providing a small number of examples (typically between 1 and 10) directly within your prompt to demonstrate the desired input-output format, style, or task, helping the AI generate accurate and relevant responses.

Challenge:

The NextMobile social media team wants to create short, engaging tweets announcing service updates (like planned maintenance or new coverage areas). They have a specific, concise style they want to maintain. Your task is to use Few-Shot Prompting by providing two or three examples of past service update tweets in your prompt, and then asking the AI to draft a new tweet for a planned network maintenance in a specific city, based on those examples.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
