### Solution (Right Side Content)
Output Formatting is incredibly powerful - it transforms raw AI content into perfectly structured, customer-ready materials that drive action and decisions.

Here's how Output Formatting works:

**Example Prompt:**
Create a formatted comparison chart between NextMobile's fiber and cable internet plans for website visitors who are choosing their internet service. Use a clear table format with the following structure: Feature | NextMobile Fiber | NextMobile Cable | Best For. Include key comparison points that matter most to customers: speed, reliability, price, installation, and long-term value. Make it easy to scan and highlight the advantages of each option.

**Example Output:**
| Feature | NextMobile Fiber | NextMobile Cable | Best For |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Download Speed** | Up to 1Gbps | Up to 300Mbps | Heavy users, 4K streaming |
| **Upload Speed** | Up to 1Gbps | Up to 50Mbps | Content creators, remote work |
| **Latency** | 1-5ms | 15-30ms | Gaming, video conferencing |
| **Reliability** | 99.9% uptime | 99.5% uptime | Business users, critical work |
| **Monthly Cost** | $79.99 | $59.99 | Budget-conscious customers |
| **Installation** | Professional setup | Self-install option | Quick setup needs |
| **Long-term Value** | Future-proof technology | Established infrastructure | Tech enthusiasts vs. stability seekers |

**Key Insight:**
Output Formatting transforms raw information into structured, customer-focused content. The right format helps customers make informed decisions by presenting complex technical information in a scannable, easy-to-understand format that highlights what matters most to them.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Create an FAQ format for NextMobile's most common installation questions
2. Design a checklist format for customers preparing for internet service upgrade
3. Build a pricing grid comparing all NextMobile plans with features

**Common Pitfalls:**
❌ **Leaving format ambiguous**: Customers need clear structure for decision-making
❌ **Mixing incompatible formats**: Confuses the buying process and user experience
✅ **Specify exact structure needed**: Clear formatting guides customer decisions
✅ **Include headers that guide customers**: Through comparisons and key information

**Pro Tips:**
✅ **Always specify exact format requirements upfront**: Tell AI exactly what structure you need
✅ **Test formatted outputs in your actual systems**: CMS, email, website before publishing
✅ **Create format templates for common content types**: Save time and ensure consistency
❌ **Don't assume AI will infer the format**: Be explicit about structure requirements
❌ **Don't ignore mobile formatting**: Consider how content appears on all devices
