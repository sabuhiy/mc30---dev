Subject: Day 12: Does Example Order Matter for NextMobile Prompts?

Pre-header: Discover how sequencing examples affects AI output in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 12 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore the concept of Exemplar Ordering in Few-Shot Prompting. The sequence in which you present examples to the AI within your prompt can subtly, or sometimes significantly, influence the output it generates. Understanding this effect allows for more precise control over AI responses.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team is testing variations of promotional headlines for a new Smart Thermostat. You plan to use Few-Shot Prompting with a few examples of successful past headlines. Your task is to experiment with the order of these examples in your prompt and observe if the generated headlines for the Smart Thermostat differ based on the sequence of the examples.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
