Pre-header: Master Style Prompting to control tone, voice, and style for perfect brand alignment across different marketing channels.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 6 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've learned to assign roles to influence AI output. Today, we refine that control even further with Style Prompting. This technique allows you to dictate the specific tone, voice, or style of the AI's generated text, ensuring it perfectly matches your brand's identity and the nuances required for different marketing channels and audiences.

NextMobile's social media team manages multiple platforms and needs to maintain brand consistency while adapting content for each platform's unique audience and style. The same product announcement about their new business fiber service needs to work on professional LinkedIn and casual Instagram, but the tone and approach must be completely different. Your challenge is to use style prompting to create platform-specific versions of NextMobile's business fiber announcement that maintain brand voice while fitting each platform's communication style.

Best, Sab
