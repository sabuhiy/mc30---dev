Subject: Day 18: Take a Step Back with Step-Back Prompting for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how a high-level question improves AI explanations in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 18 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Step-Back Prompting. This technique involves asking the AI a more generic, high-level question related to the core concept before asking your specific, detailed question. This helps the AI build a better foundation for its response, often leading to more comprehensive and accurate explanations.

Challenge:

The NextMobile B2B marketing team needs to explain complex network technologies, like "5G network slicing," to potential business clients who may not have deep technical knowledge. Simply explaining the technical details can be overwhelming. Your task is to use Step-Back Prompting to get the AI to explain 5G network slicing by first asking a higher-level question about the general concept of network allocation or customization.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
