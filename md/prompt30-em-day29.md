Subject: Day 29: Explore Multimodal Prompting for NextMobile (Conceptually)

Pre-header: Think beyond text in today's conceptual challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 29 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, we'll conceptually explore Multimodal Prompting. While your primary focus has been text-based prompts, AI models are increasingly capable of processing and generating content across different modalities, such as images, audio, and video. Understanding how to interact with these models is the future of AI in marketing.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team is planning a visual campaign for a new smart home security camera, focusing on ease of installation. Imagine you have a short video clip demonstrating the simple setup process. Your task is to conceptually design a prompt you would use to instruct an AI model (capable of processing video) to generate a concise, engaging social media caption for this video clip, highlighting the ease of installation and peace of mind.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
