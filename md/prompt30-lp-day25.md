# Day 25 - Understand Prompt Sensitivity

Welcome to Day 25 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You're in the advanced stages of your prompt engineering journey, exploring the nuances of AI behavior. Today's concept, Prompt Sensitivity, is a crucial one for anyone seeking consistent and reliable outputs. It demonstrates that AI models can be highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt wording or structure, sometimes in unpredictable ways.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is launching an exciting new loyalty program to reward our long-term customers. The marketing team needs a short, engaging message about this program for various digital channels. You've already drafted a prompt that generates a good message. Your challenge is to experience prompt sensitivity firsthand by making a minimal change to this prompt and observing the resulting difference in the AI's output.

### Task:

1. Write a prompt to generate a short promotional message for the new NextMobile customer loyalty program, highlighting exclusive rewards.

2. Take that prompt and make a very small change (e.g., add or remove a comma, change capitalization slightly).

3. Run both the original and the slightly modified prompt and compare the generated messages for the loyalty program.

## Solution (Right Side Content)
Great job! By experimenting with prompt sensitivity, you've seen how even minor changes can influence AI output. This awareness is vital for debugging unexpected results and striving for greater consistency in your AI-generated marketing content. Get prepared for Day 26!

### Example Prompt (Original):

Write a short promotional message for the new NextMobile customer loyalty program. Focus on exclusive rewards for loyal customers.

### Example Output (Original):

Introducing the new NextMobile Loyalty Program! Get exclusive rewards just for being a loyal customer. Sign up today!

### Example Prompt (Modified - added a comma):

Write a short promotional message for the new NextMobile customer loyalty program, focusing on exclusive rewards for loyal customers.

### Example Output (Modified):

Introducing the new NextMobile Loyalty Program! We appreciate your loyalty â€“ earn exclusive rewards just for being a valued customer. Join now!

### Explanation:

This example demonstrates how a seemingly small change in the prompt (adding a comma after "program" and changing the structure slightly) led to a different output message. The modified prompt resulted in a message that included an extra phrase ("We appreciate your loyalty") and used "valued customer" instead of "loyal customer," and "Join now!" instead of "Sign up today!". 

While both outputs are relevant, the subtle differences highlight prompt sensitivity. This means that when you are refining prompts and getting unexpected results, sometimes the issue might be a very small detail in your wording or formatting. Being aware of this helps you troubleshoot and iterate more effectively to achieve the desired, consistent output for NextMobile's marketing materials.
