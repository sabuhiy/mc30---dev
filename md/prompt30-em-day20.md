Subject: Day 20: Solve Step-by-Step with Least-to-Most Prompting for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn to break down and solve problems in sequence in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 20 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will learn about Least-to-Most Prompting. This technique is a form of decomposition where you break a problem into sub-problems and solve them sequentially, using the output of one step as input for the next. This is particularly effective for complex tasks that require building upon previous results.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team wants to generate a detailed comparison between two different internet plans (e.g., a Fiber plan and a Cable plan) for a customer who is trying to decide which is best for their needs. Simply asking for a comparison might yield a generic result. Your task is to use Least-to-Most Prompting by first asking the AI to list the key comparison points for internet plans, and then, in a follow-up prompt, asking it to provide a comparison of the two specific NextMobile plans based on those points.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
