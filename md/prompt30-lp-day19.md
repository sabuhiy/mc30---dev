# Day 19 - Master Decomposition

Welcome to Day 19 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've explored techniques for guiding AI reasoning. Today, we apply a strategy for tackling large, complex marketing projects: Decomposition. Just as you might break down a project into smaller tasks, you can break down a complex prompting request into a series of simpler prompts. This makes the overall task more manageable for the AI and improves the quality of the final output.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is launching a new, super-fast internet tier, and a robust content plan is needed to announce it across various channels. Asking the AI to generate "a content plan" in a single prompt might yield a superficial result. Your challenge is to use Decomposition to build this plan by first identifying the components needed and then generating content for those components in separate steps.

### Task:

Use Decomposition to start creating a content plan for the launch of a new NextMobile high-speed internet tier.

1. Write a prompt asking the AI to list the key types of marketing content needed for a new product launch (e.g., website, social media, email, blog).
2. Based on the AI's response from step 1, choose one content type (e.g., social media) and write a new prompt asking the AI to generate specific content ideas for that type for the new internet tier launch.

### Example Prompt 1 (Decomposition Step 1):

List the key types of marketing content needed for the launch of a new high-speed internet service tier.

### Example Output 1:

Key types of marketing content for a new high-speed internet service tier launch:

- Website Landing Page Copy
- Social Media Posts (Announcement, Feature Highlights, Testimonials)
- Email Marketing Campaign (Announcement, Benefits, Call to Action)
- Blog Posts/Articles (Explainer of technology, Comparison to old speeds, Use cases)
- Press Release
- Digital Ad Copy (Banners, Search Ads)
- Video Script Ideas (Explainer video, Customer testimonial video)
- FAQ Content

### Example Prompt 2 (Decomposition Step 2 - focusing on Social Media):

Generate 5 specific social media post ideas for the launch of a new NextMobile high-speed internet tier, based on the content types listed previously. Focus on exciting language and the benefit of speed.

This example demonstrates the power of Decomposition. By first asking the AI to list the required content types, you get a structured overview (Example Output 1). You can then take one of those components (like Social Media) and create a new, more focused prompt (Example Prompt 2) to generate specific ideas for that category (Example Output 2). This multi-step approach ensures you cover all necessary areas of your content plan comprehensively, rather than getting a superficial list of ideas in a single, broad prompt. Decomposition is a vital strategy for managing complexity and achieving detailed results with AI.
