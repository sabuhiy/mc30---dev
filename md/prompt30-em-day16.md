Subject: Day 16: Reason Step-by-Step with Zero-Shot CoT for NextMobile

Pre-header: Encourage AI reasoning with just instructions in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 16 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This technique allows you to prompt the AI to perform step-by-step reasoning using only a thought-inducing phrase, without needing to provide any examples. It's a powerful way to get the AI to break down a problem or explain a concept logically.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team needs compelling copy explaining the combined value of bundling NextMobile internet and mobile services. Instead of just listing features, they want to articulate why bundling is a smart choice. Your task is to use Zero-Shot CoT prompting to instruct the AI to explain the benefits of bundling by first reasoning through how the services complement each other.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
