Subject: Day 23: Ensure Reliability with Self-Consistency for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how to check for consistent AI recommendations in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 23 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Self-Consistency. This technique, often used with reasoning tasks, involves prompting the AI multiple times for the same request and checking if the outputs are consistent. If a majority of outputs converge on the same answer, it suggests a higher likelihood of accuracy. This is valuable for ensuring reliable AI-generated recommendations or analyses.

Challenge:

The NextMobile website team wants to use AI to help customers choose the best internet plan based on their needs. To ensure the AI provides reliable recommendations, your task is to prompt the AI to recommend a NextMobile internet plan for a specific customer profile (a family of four with heavy internet usage, including 4K streaming and online gaming). Use a method to check for self-consistency in the AI's recommendation, observing if the same plan is suggested when the prompt is effectively run multiple times.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
