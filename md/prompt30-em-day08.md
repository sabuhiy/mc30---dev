Subject: Day 8: Learn from Examples with ICL for NextMobile

Pre-header: Discover how providing examples in your prompts boosts AI performance!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 8 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will be introduced to In-Context Learning (ICL). This powerful capability of AI models allows them to learn from examples provided directly within your prompt, without needing any external training. By showing the AI what you want, you can guide its output more effectively.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team has a collection of high-performing short promotional texts for various accessories. They need to generate a similar style of promotional text for a new phone case. Your task is to use ICL by providing a couple of examples of the successful promotional texts in your prompt and then asking the AI to generate one for the new phone case based on those examples.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
