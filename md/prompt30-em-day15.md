Subject: Day 15: Uncover AI Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how to get the AI to show its work in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 15 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting. This advanced technique encourages the AI to articulate its reasoning process step-by-step before arriving at a final answer or output. Understanding the AI's "thought process" can be incredibly valuable for complex tasks and generating more detailed content.

Challenge:

The NextMobile product marketing team needs to explain why certain phone features are beneficial to customers, not just state the benefit. Your task is to use CoT prompting to get the AI to explain the benefit of a specific phone feature (e.g., a high refresh rate screen) by first outlining the steps of its reasoning process.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
