# Day 11 - Experiment with Exemplar Quantity

Welcome to Day 11 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You're getting comfortable with using examples in your prompts through Few-Shot Prompting. Today, we focus on a specific aspect of this technique: the quantity of examples. Does providing more examples always lead to better or different results? Let's find out through experimentation.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is launching a major campaign for the new UltraConnect Pro smartphone. The team needs several short, attention-grabbing ad variations for digital platforms. You have some examples of successful past ad copy. Your challenge is to test the impact of providing a different number of these examples in your few-shot prompts and analyze how the AI's generated ad variations change.

### Task:

Write two few-shot prompts to generate a short ad variation for the NextMobile UltraConnect Pro.

1. Use only one example of a short, punchy ad.
2. Use five examples of short, punchy ads.
3. Compare the generated ad variations from both prompts.

## Solution (Right Side Content)
Great job! By experimenting with exemplar quantity, you've gained insight into how the number of examples can influence the AI's output. This understanding helps you decide how many examples are appropriate for different tasks. Get prepared for Day 12!

### Example Prompt (One Example):

Here is an example of a short ad:
Example: Get blazing fast internet speeds with NextMobile Fiber! Sign up now.

Write a short, punchy ad for the new NextMobile UltraConnect Pro smartphone.

### Example Output (One Example):

Experience the future in your hand! Get the new NextMobile UltraConnect Pro. Shop today.

### Example Prompt (Five Examples):

Here are examples of short ads:
Example 1: Get blazing fast internet speeds with NextMobile Fiber! Sign up now.
Example 2: Never drop a call again! Switch to NextMobile today.
Example 3: Stream, game, and connect without limits on NextMobile's reliable network.
Example 4: Upgrade your home with NextMobile Smart Home devices. Easy setup!
Example 5: The new UltraConnect Pro is here! Power and performance in your pocket.

Write a short, punchy ad for the new NextMobile UltraConnect Pro smartphone.

### Example Output (Five Examples):

Power meets speed. Discover the new NextMobile UltraConnect Pro. Learn more!

This example illustrates how varying the number of exemplars can subtly or significantly alter the AI's output. With one example, the AI might capture the basic structure. With five examples, it has more data points to understand the desired tone, length, and style, potentially leading to an output that is a better average of the provided examples or captures a more nuanced pattern. Observing these differences helps you determine the optimal number of examples for specific content generation tasks within NextMobile's marketing efforts. It's not always about more being better; sometimes, a few well-chosen examples are more effective than many varied ones.
