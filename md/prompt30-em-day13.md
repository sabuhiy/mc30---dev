Subject: Day 13: Format Your Examples for Better AI Results at NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how the structure of your examples influences AI output in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 13 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore the concept of Exemplar Format. When using Few-Shot Prompting, the way you structure your examples (e.g., using "Input: Output:", bullet points, or simple pairs) can affect how well the AI understands the pattern and generates its response.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team needs consistent, short benefit statements for various smart home devices to use on product pages. You've noticed that the format of your examples impacts the AI's output. Your task is to experiment with two different formats for providing examples in a few-shot prompt and observe how the generated benefit statements for a new NextMobile Smart Lock differ based on the example format.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
