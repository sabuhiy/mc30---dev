Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 2 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today's focus is on Prompt Templates. You will learn what a prompt template is and how to use them to create reusable structures for your AI prompts. This is a powerful technique for maintaining consistency and efficiency in your marketing content generation.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team frequently creates social media posts for various products and services. To streamline this process, your task is to create a prompt template that can be easily adapted for different NextMobile offerings (like a new phone, a high-speed internet plan, or a smart home device). This template should use placeholders for the specific product/service name and its key benefits.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,
