Subject: Day 7: Structure Your AI Outputs with Formatting for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn to control how your AI presents information in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 7 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will learn about Output Formatting. This technique allows you to instruct the AI to structure its generated text in specific formats, such as bullet points, numbered lists, tables, or even code snippets. Controlling the output format is essential for generating content that is immediately usable and easy to read for your marketing materials.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team is preparing a fact sheet for a new high-speed fiber internet plan. They need a clear, concise list of the plan's key features that can be easily copied and pasted into various internal and external documents. Your task is to use Output Formatting in your prompt to generate this list specifically as a markdown bulleted list.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
