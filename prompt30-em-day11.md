Subject: Day 11: Experiment with Exemplar Quantity for NextMobile Content

Pre-header: Discover how the number of examples impacts AI output in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 11 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore the concept of Exemplar Quantity in Few-Shot Prompting. The number of examples you provide in your prompt can influence the AI's understanding and the quality or style of the generated output. Experimenting with quantity is a key part of prompt engineering.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team needs short, punchy ad variations for a new flagship smartphone. You've been using Few-Shot Prompting, but you want to see if providing more examples changes the output significantly. Your task is to experiment with generating ad variations using different numbers of examples (e.g., 1 example vs. 5 examples) and observe the differences in the AI's output.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
