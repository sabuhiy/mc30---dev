Subject: Day 21: Think Like a Program with Program-of-Thoughts for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn to structure AI reasoning in logical steps in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 21 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Program-of-Thoughts. This technique encourages the AI to generate reasoning steps in a structured format, similar to lines of code or logical commands. This can be particularly useful for tasks involving calculations, data manipulation, or complex logical sequences, allowing you to see and verify the AI's step-by-step process.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team wants to create content that helps customers understand the potential cost savings of switching to a new unlimited data plan based on their current data usage. Simply asking the AI to state the savings might not be transparent. Your task is to use a Program-of-Thoughts approach to get the AI to outline the calculation steps needed to determine the monthly savings for a customer based on their current data usage and the cost of the new unlimited plan.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
