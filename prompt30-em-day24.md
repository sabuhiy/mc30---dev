Subject: Day 24: Get AI Feedback with Self-Criticism for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how to ask the AI to critique its own work in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 24 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will explore Self-Criticism. This advanced technique involves prompting the AI to evaluate or provide feedback on its own previously generated output. It's a powerful way to refine content, identify potential issues, and leverage the AI's analytical capabilities to improve its own creative work.

Challenge:

The NextMobile social media team needs a concise ad for a new smart home security sensor. You've used AI to draft an initial version, but you want to see if the AI can identify areas for improvement itself. Your task is to first prompt the AI to write a short social media ad for the sensor, and then, in a follow-up prompt, ask the AI to critique that ad and suggest specific improvements.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
