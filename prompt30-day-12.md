# Day 12: Experiment with Exemplar Ordering

Subject: Day 12: Order Matters More Than You Think

Pre-header: Learn how the sequence of examples in your prompts can influence AI output and bias.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 12 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

Yesterday you discovered the optimal quantity of examples for consistent AI output. Today, we focus on another critical aspect: the order in which you present those examples. The sequence can create a subtle bias or highlight certain patterns for the AI, leading to different outputs.

NextMobile's social media team has three high-performing post examples for their 5G service announcement, but they're getting inconsistent results when using them in prompts. The team noticed that depending on how they order the examples, the AI generates content with different tones and focuses - sometimes more technical, sometimes more emotional, sometimes more benefit-focused. The marketing director wants to understand this pattern to strategically control the AI's output style. Your challenge is to experiment with different example orders to discover how the sequence of examples influences AI behavior and learn to use this strategically for NextMobile's content creation.

Let's unlock the power of sequence!

Best, Sab

### Challenge Detail
Yesterday you discovered the optimal quantity of examples for consistent AI output. Today, we focus on another critical aspect: the order in which you present those examples. The sequence can create a subtle bias or highlight certain patterns for the AI, leading to different outputs.

### Task
Create the same prompt with examples in different orders and observe how the sequence affects the AI's output patterns. Test at least two different orderings and analyze the differences in tone, focus, and style.

### Resources

### Solution (Right Side Content)
Exemplar Ordering is incredibly powerful - it gives you strategic control over AI output tone and style by leveraging the natural bias that sequence creates in pattern recognition.

Here's how Exemplar Ordering works:

**Example Prompt (Emotional-First Order):**
Create a social media post about NextMobile's 5G network expansion. Use these examples as inspiration:

1. "üåü NextMobile 5G makes me feel so connected to what matters most! #Connection"
2. "Experience 2Gbps speeds with sub-10ms latency that keeps you ahead of the game."
3. "Join thousands who've upgraded their digital life with NextMobile's reliability."

Create a post about our new 5G coverage in downtown area.

**Example Output (Emotional-First):**
"üíï Finally, downtown has the connection that brings families closer! NextMobile's new 5G coverage means crystal-clear video calls with loved ones and seamless sharing of life's precious moments. Join our growing community of connected neighbors! #NextMobileFamily #DowntownConnected"

**Example Prompt (Technical-First Order):**
Create a social media post about NextMobile's 5G network expansion. Use these examples as inspiration:

1. "NextMobile's 5G network delivers 2Gbps download speeds with sub-10ms latency."
2. "Join thousands who've upgraded their digital life with NextMobile's reliability."
3. "üåü Feel connected to what matters most with our advanced network technology!"

Create a post about our new 5G coverage in downtown area.

**Example Output (Technical-First):**
"üöÄ Downtown now powered by NextMobile's advanced 5G infrastructure: 2Gbps speeds, sub-10ms latency, and 99.9% uptime guarantee. Superior millimeter wave technology for maximum performance. #5GTech #NextMobileNetwork #DowntownUpgrade"

**Key Insight:**
Example ordering creates predictable bias in AI output - the last example in your sequence often sets the dominant tone, giving you strategic control over messaging style and audience impact for your campaigns.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Test emotional-first vs technical-first ordering for NextMobile's social media posts
2. Create the same campaign with different example sequences and compare results
3. Apply ordering strategies to different social media platforms (Instagram vs LinkedIn)

**Common Pitfalls:**
‚ùå **Random sequencing**: Uncontrolled messaging dilutes campaign impact
‚ùå **Platform ignorance**: Same ordering across different social platforms
‚úÖ **Place your most important style/tone example last**: Controls dominant output tone
‚úÖ **Test different orderings with the same examples**: Reveals sequence impact

**Pro Tips:**
‚úÖ **Place your most important style/tone example last**: Controls the dominant output pattern
‚úÖ **Test different orderings with the same examples**: Reveals how sequence affects results
‚úÖ **Use consistent ordering strategies across similar content**: Maintains brand voice
‚ùå **Don't randomly order examples without testing**: Sequence matters more than you think
‚ùå **Don't ignore the impact of your last example**: It often sets the dominant tone
