Pre-header: Learn Chain of Thought prompting to get AI to show its reasoning process.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 16 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

Yesterday you learned how persona prompting creates consistent brand voice across all AI-generated content. Today, we explore Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting - a technique that encourages AI to break down complex problems into logical steps, showing its reasoning process. This is particularly valuable for calculations, analysis, and decision-making scenarios.

NextMobile's sales team needs to create compelling ROI calculations for potential business customers, but they want the AI to show the complete reasoning process behind each calculation. When customers see the step-by-step logic of how NextMobile's services save money and increase productivity, they're more likely to trust the numbers and make a purchase decision. The team wants to use Chain of Thought prompting to generate transparent, logical explanations that walk customers through the financial benefits of switching to NextMobile's business internet services.

Let's make AI thinking transparent!

Best, Sab

### Solution (Right Side Content)
Chain of Thought Prompting is incredibly powerful - it creates transparent, trustworthy ROI calculations that help business customers understand exactly how NextMobile's services deliver value, increasing sales conversion rates.

Here's how Chain of Thought Prompting works:

**Example Prompt:**
Calculate the ROI of switching to NextMobile's business fiber for a 50-employee company. Show your reasoning step by step:

**Example Output:**
Let me walk you through the ROI calculation for NextMobile's business fiber:

**Step 1: Current Cost Analysis**
- Current internet: $200/month cable internet
- Annual cost: $200 × 12 = $2,400

**Step 2: Productivity Impact Assessment**
- 50 employees × $50/hour average wage = $2,500/hour total cost
- Current downtime: 2 hours/month due to slow speeds
- Monthly productivity loss: $2,500 × 2 = $5,000

**Step 3: NextMobile Business Fiber Investment**
- Monthly cost: $350 (fiber service)
- Annual cost: $350 × 12 = $4,200
- Additional investment: $4,200 - $2,400 = $1,800

**Step 4: Productivity Gains**
- Fiber reliability eliminates 95% of downtime
- Reduced downtime: 2 hours → 0.1 hours/month
- Monthly savings: $2,500 × 1.9 hours = $4,750

**Step 5: ROI Calculation**
- Monthly net benefit: $4,750 - $150 (extra cost) = $4,600
- Annual net benefit: $4,600 × 12 = $55,200
- ROI: ($55,200 ÷ $1,800) × 100 = 3,067%

**Conclusion:** The company saves $55,200 annually with a 3,067% ROI in the first year.

**Key Insight:**
Chain of Thought prompting creates transparent, trustworthy ROI calculations that help business customers understand exactly how NextMobile's services deliver value, increasing sales conversion rates through clear step-by-step reasoning.
