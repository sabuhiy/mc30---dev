# Instructions for Creating Use Cases from Slack Threads

## Overview
These instructions guide the process of analyzing Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) Next Slack threads and transforming them into comprehensive, business-focused use cases for the MC30 Next challenge.

## Analyzing Slack Threads

### Step 1: Extract Core Information
When analyzing a Slack thread, identify:
1. **The Problem Owner**: Who is asking the question?
2. **The Technical Challenge**: What specific SFMC Next feature or functionality are they struggling with?
3. **The Business Context**: What are they trying to accomplish from a business perspective?
4. **The Solution Provided**: What technical solutions were suggested by the community?
5. **Key Features/Concepts**: What SFMC Next features are involved (e.g., Segment Triggered Flows, Decision Splits, Exit Rules, etc.)?

### Step 2: Transform Technical Questions into Business Scenarios
Convert the technical problem into a relatable business scenario:
- Use **NextMobile** as the fictional company name for all use cases
- Define a specific business team (e.g., product marketing, customer success, sales, customer acquisition)
- Frame the challenge as a real-world business need, not just a technical question
- Focus on the business outcome (conversions, retention, engagement) rather than just the technical implementation

### Step 3: Focus on the Solution and Learning
Emphasize:
- **The Challenge**: What business problem needs to be solved
- **The Solution**: What SFMC Next features and best practices address this need
- **The Learning**: What strategic capabilities this demonstrates

## Use Case Structure

During the discovery phase, each use case should be concise and focused on the core scenario:

```markdown
## [Use Case Title]
NextMobile's [team/department] is [business objective/initiative] and needs to [specific business need/challenge they're facing].

**Internal Note - Solution:** [Brief explanation of the solution/approach from the Slack thread]
```

**Note**: 
- The use case description should present only the business challenge, without prescribing a solution
- The internal note documents the solution approach from the Slack thread for future reference during content development
- Additional sections like Key Learning Points, SFMC Next Features, and Business Impact will be added during the content development phase
- During discovery, focus on crafting a clear, compelling use case description and capturing the solution approach

## Writing Guidelines

### DO:
✅ Create realistic business scenarios that teams can relate to
✅ Focus on business outcomes (revenue, retention, engagement, efficiency)
✅ Frame challenges as learning opportunities
✅ Use industry-specific terminology appropriate to the fictional company
✅ Emphasize the solution and what can be achieved with SFMC Next
✅ Make the use case actionable and specific
✅ Include clear success criteria or desired outcomes

### DON'T:
❌ Write purely technical descriptions without business context
❌ Use actual Slack usernames or real company names in the use case
❌ Make the scenario too simple or trivial
❌ Focus only on the technical solution without explaining why it matters
❌ Create generic scenarios that could apply to any marketing platform
❌ Overcomplicate the scenario with unnecessary details

## Examples of Transformation

### From Thread to Use Case:

**Slack Thread**: "How do I remove contacts from a segment-triggered flow after they make a purchase?"

**Use Case**: "NextMobile's customer acquisition team is running a product launch campaign with multiple touchpoints over 7 days. They need to ensure that once a customer purchases, they immediately stop receiving promotional emails and instead enter a post-purchase nurture sequence."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a use case, ensure:
- [ ] The scenario is business-focused, not just technical
- [ ] The challenge is clear and relatable
- [ ] The learning objective is specific to SFMC Next capabilities
- [ ] The company name and context feel realistic
- [ ] The use case demonstrates best practices, not just feature usage
- [ ] The outcome matters to the business (not just "make it work")
- [ ] Key SFMC Next features are implicit in the scenario

## Template Variables

When creating use cases, vary these elements for NextMobile:
- **Business Lines**: Mobile services, internet packages, business solutions, device sales, bundled offerings
- **Teams**: Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Product Marketing, Retention, Support
- **Campaigns**: Product launches, seasonal promotions, lifecycle campaigns, re-engagement, onboarding, upgrade campaigns
- **Challenges**: Segmentation, personalization, timing, data management, automation, reporting, customer journey orchestration

## Notes
- Each use case should teach a specific lesson about SFMC Next
- Use cases should progressively build in complexity throughout the 30-day challenge
- Focus on real pain points that SFMC Next solves better than traditional approaches
- Emphasize the "Next" capabilities (unified profiles, real-time segments, modern UI, etc.)
