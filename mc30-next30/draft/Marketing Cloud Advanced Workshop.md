## **Slide 21: Glossary of Terms**

Salesforce Data Cloud organizes and unifies data across Salesforce and other external data sources.

### **Data Cloud Terms**

* **Customer 360 Data Model:** The standard, canonical data model used for Data Cloud to help with interoperability across systems.  
* **Data Bundle:** A collection of data streams that are automatically mapped to Data Model Objects (DMO), e.g., a Salesforce CRM bundle.  
* **Data Graph:** A grouping of data created by combining and transforming normalized table data from Data Model Objects (DMOs) into new, materialized views.  
* **Data Kit:** A portable and customized bundle of packageable metadata, created within Data Cloud to streamline the package creation and installation process.  
* **Data Model Object (DMO):** A standard or custom grouping of data (made up of attributes) created from data streams, insights, and other sources.  
* **Data Stream:** A data source brought into Data Cloud. These can be batched or streaming data.  
* **Identity Resolution Ruleset:** Rulesets are a combination of match and reconciliation rules used to combine source records to resolve identity and create unified profiles.  
* **Metadata:** Data that describes other data (fields, configurations, code).  
* **Permission Set Licenses (PSLs):** A collection of permissions and settings that gives users access to specific tools and functions.  
* **Reconciliation Rules:** User-defined rules that determine which source the system uses when creating unified individual profiles (Last updated, Most frequent, or Source priority).  
* **Tenant-Specific Endpoint (TSE):** A unique system-generated subdomain assigned to your tenant.  
* **Unified Individual Object/Unified Profile:** A profile that contains customer data reconciled across multiple sources as a single record using identity resolution.

### **Marketing Cloud Account Engagement**

As of Winter '25 release, Marketing Cloud Account Engagement instances meeting the qualifications will obtain access to **Marketing Cloud Growth Edition features via Permission Set Licenses (PSLs)**.

## **Slide 22: Data Streams in Data Cloud**

Customer data records are stored in data streams and they include:

* **Mappings:** The relationship your data has in Data Cloud with its source.  
* **Fields:** The fields available for your segmentation or personalization.  
* **Refresh rates:** How often the data refreshes, which will feed your segments.

**PRO TIP\!** When you're planning your use case, consider how "fresh" you need that data to be in order for the campaign to be relevant and effective.

* Only mapped fields or objects with relationships can be used for segmentation and insights.

## **Slide 23: Data Streams Structure**

**For data to be usable in MCG/A, it must first be configured as DMO**

* **Data Load Objects...** (Raw data related to the object being ingested)  
  * ...get mapped to... (Note: Part of the value of data packages is they come with predefined data mappings)  
* **...Data Model Objects** (Structured Data Cloud objects that have relationships w/ one another)

## **Slide 24: Data Streams Structure \- Relationships**

Different DMOs will have 1:1 or 1:n relationships with each other (cardinality).

The **Individual DMO** has a **ManyToOne** relationship with the **Contact Point Email DMO**. A particular individual person could have multiple email records associated with them.

## **Slide 25: Data Kits**

**Data Kits make the MCG/A installation much easier**

Data Cloud objects, such as metadata, relationships, and other components, wrapped together to be installed with a few easy clicks.

### **Considerations:**

* Creates DMOs to make CRM data available for Marketing Cloud Growth & Advanced. The Sales Data Kit for example contains data streams for accounts, leads, and contacts.  
* Do your use cases require data not available within these data kits \-\> requires custom configuration.

**Required Data Kits:**

* Marketing Setup Objects Data Kit  
* Consent Objects Data Kit  
* Flows Integration Data Kit  
* Email Channel Data Kit  
* SMS Channel Data Kit

## **Slide 26: Marketing Cloud Roles & Permissions**

* **Marketing Cloud Admin:** User will be able to configure settings in Marketing Setup and further configuration of the account.  
* **Data Cloud Admin:** Access to Data Cloud Setup and whole Data Cloud instance. Will create Identity Resolution Rules.  
* **Marketing Cloud Manager:** User will create content, campaigns, segments, etc. and has the ability to initiate sends.  
* **Content Admin:** When marketers create content in CMS, they use Digital Experiences tools, which require a different set of permissions.

## **Slide 27: Marketing on Data Cloud \- Identity Resolution**

## **Slide 28: Marketing Cloud Growth and Advanced Edition Key Concepts**

**CONNECT AND UNIFY**

* **Data Streams:** A data source brought into Data Cloud.  
* **Identity Resolution Rulesets:** Rulesets are a combination of match and reconciliation rules used to combine source records to resolve identity and create unified profiles.

**ACTIVATE**

* **Unified Individuals:** A profile that contains customer data reconciled across multiple sources as a single record using identity resolution rulesets.  
* **Segments:** A set of objects (for example individuals in B2C) that share some set of characteristics.  
* **Consent:** Consent lives with the Unified Individual, and is maintained by the channel level.

**Summary:** Data Streams bring data in. Identity Resolution Rulesets organize incoming data to create Unified Profiles. Unified Individuals/Profiles are used to create segments. Consent lives with the Unified Profile and is based off of communication channel. Data coming in effects communications going out.

## **Slide 29: Unified Individual**

**Consolidating multiple records based on your chosen Identity Resolution rules**

* Unified Individuals are lead or contact records comprised of data from many sources.  
* Data Cloud brings together all types of data from your business (with different addresses, emails, phone numbers) and creates an entity called a **Unified Profile**.  
* That profile is considered marketable once filtered by the IR rule.

## **Slide 30: Identity Resolution Rules**

**Criteria used to match and consolidate data from different sources, creating a Unified Individual record**

* A marketer can then use those Unified Individual records for audience targeting.  
* During installation, you can choose either a **default match rule** or create **custom logic**.  
* MCG/A selects one Unified Individual record and then sends to that record's email address.

**Match Rules (Default Options):**

* Fuzzy Name and Normalized Email  
* Fuzzy Name and Normalized Phone  
* Fuzzy Name and Normalized Address  
* Fuzzy Name and Normalized Phone and Normalized Email  
* Custom Rule

**PRO TIP\!** MCG will send only one email to multiple individuals with the same email address.

## **Slide 31: Identity Resolution Best Practice**

The **Customer 360 Data Model** reduces the complexities of integrating data across cloud applications by providing standardized data guidelines. It is organized into subject areas. A subject area consists of data model objects (DMO).

### **Working with Identity Resolution Rulesets Considerations:**

* Standard DMOs are mapped in the Data Kits installation.  
* DMOs used are related to the Customer 360 Model.  
* **Best Practice:** Map your data against the canonical 360 Data Model as often as possible.

## **Slide 32: Identity Resolution \- Data Cloud: Data & Identity**

## **Slide 33: Match Rule Balancing**

**Custom or Standard? Your data is your best guide.**

The goal: striking a balance between match logic that is either "**too specific**" (an 'undermatch') or "**too generic**" (an 'overmatch').

* **High Consolidation Rate / High Overgrouping Risk:** Match Rule Option 1: One connected Contact Point (Email OR Phone OR Party Identifier OR Address OR Device)  
* **Medium Consolidation Rate / Medium Overgrouping Risk:** Match Rule Option 2: Individual Attributes AND Contact Points (Individual Attributes \+ Phone OR Individual Attributes \+ Email OR Other Contact Point Combinations)  
* **Low Consolidation Rate / Low Overgrouping Risk (Best Practice):** Match Rule Option 3: Individual Attributes, Contact Points, AND Party Identifiers (Individual Attributes \+ Party Identifier \+ Address OR Individual Attributes \+ Phone \+ Email)

**PRO TIP\!** IR Rules that are too generic can introduce error. IR Rules that are too specific can prevent you from generating greater insights.

## **Slide 34: Reconciliation Rules**

**If multiple values exist, define how to pick "a winner"**

A reconciliation rule specifies how to save single values to a unified field that can't have multiple values, such as an individual's name, during the identity resolution process.

**Values can be reconciled by:**

* **Last Updated**  
* **Most Frequent**  
* **Source Priority**

## **Slide 35: Reconciliation Rules \- Source Priority**

Selecting "**Source Priority**" as reconciliation rule will allow you to define an order based on the DLOs mapped to the Individual Record.

* **Example Order:**  
  1. Contact\_Home  
  2. Lead\_Home  
  3. Prospect\_Home

## **Slide 36: Individual DMO**

**A Standardized View of a Human**

| Source System | Data Stream / DLO | Data Cloud DMO |  
| CRM (LEADS) | LEADS Data Stream / DLO | INDIVIDUALS |  
| CRM (CONTACTS) | CONTACTS Data Stream / DLO | INDIVIDUALS |  
| OTHER SYSTEM (EXT. PROFILE) | EXT. PROFILE Data Stream / DLO | INDIVIDUALS |

## **Slide 37: What is a Unified Individual?**

**A set of one or more Individuals presented as one record**

The process involves:

1. **MATCH:** Multiple Individual records are matched based on rules.  
2. **RECONCILE:** The matched Individuals are reconciled to form a single **Unified Individual** record.

## **Slide 38: Speedy Identity Resolution**

**Faster Processing**

Frequent Ruleset Processing ensures you don't have to wait for your daily ruleset to run. Your rulesets run whenever your data changes.

* Make sure "**Run jobs automatically**" is checked in IR ruleset.  
* Faster processing runs every hour if it detects 500+ changes (only works for orgs that have \>1M records).  
* It will still run a full refresh every 24hrs.  
* True real-time is separate and requires a Real-Time SKU.  
* Process can be triggered manually via "Run Ruleset" button or API.

## **Slide 39: Marketing Cloud on Core Data Foundation**

| Marketing Cloud on Core / Salesforce | Data Cloud |  
| Forms | Unified Individuals |  
| Leads / Contacts / Prospects | Individuals / Contact Points |  
| Flows | Engagements / Augmented Values |  
| Send Emails / Change SF Values | Messages |  
| Assets | Fields / Related Lists / Data Graph / Consent / Calculated Insights |  
| Web / Email / SMS / WhatsApp | Segments |  
| Group of Unified Individuals | Calculated Insights / Other DMO / Fields |  
| Consent | Current state of subscriptions (Opt In or Opt Out) |

## **Slide 40: Marketing on Data Cloud \- Data Graphs**

## **Slide 41: Content Personalization (Cross Object Merge Fields)**

**Data Graphs increase personalization beyond your standard merge fields**

* **Personalize emails with any attribute related to the Unified Individual:** Create merge fields that go beyond the profile record to include product purchased, actions, engagement, and more.  
* **Build merge fields that consider related fields:** Send updated information on customer case status, how many days are left in a free trial, and more.  
* **Leverage your entire data set when personalizing emails:** Ensure data pulled into merge fields meet Marketing Cloud's low latency standards with Data Graphs.

**Example Merge Field:** {{profile.firstName}}, we hope you enjoyed your recent purchase of {{product.attribute}}

## **Slide 42: Data Graph**

**Get a consolidated view of the data**

A data graph combines and transforms normalized table data from data model objects (DMOs) into new, materialized views of your data. This allows Data Cloud to make fewer calls, and queries respond in near real time.

* A data graph is built within a **data space** (partition) and must have one **primary data model object (DMO)**.  
* When you create the data graph, the selected objects and fields are transformed from their original hierarchical relationships into a single, flattened, read-only data graph record.  
* **Only one data graph** can be associated with your Marketing Cloud instance.

**IMPORTANT:** Using data graphs impacts the consumption of credits used for billing orgs for orgs operating Data Cloud under a Data Cloud license. For orgs operating Data Cloud under a Customer Data Platform license, data graphs use space in your allocated data storage and count toward your aggregate daily limit on queries but do not consume credits.

## **Slide 43: Creating a Data Graph**

1. Search for '**Data Graphs**' in the App Launcher.  
2. On the Data Graphs tab, click **New** and **Start from Scratch**.  
3. Fill out the **Data Graph Name**, description, and select the **primary DMO** (for this purpose, choose the Unified Individual).  
4. Click Next.

## **Slide 44: Creating a Data Graph \- Selecting Fields**

* Use the **plus symbols** next to the DMOs to select those that you wish to include in your Data Graph.  
* **Example:** If you wish to include related **Account Data** into your Data Graph for personalization, navigate to the "Account" object and check the required fields.  
* For each DMO you add, you can include **up to 20 fields**.  
* Data Graphs attributes can't be removed (yet), so plan accordingly.

**PRO TIP\!** We recommend adding all of the Unified Individual fields to your data graph, as it will replace all of the previously available Unified Individual options for personalized fields.

## **Slide 45: Select a Data Graph to use for Personalization**

Once your Data Graph is created, you'll need to go to Setup to select it for use in personalizing your messaging.

1. Search for **Reporting and Optimization** in Setup.  
2. Click on the **Customer Engagement** tab.  
3. Under **Configure Basic Personalization**, select your desired **Data Graph** from the dropdown.

## **Slide 46: Marketing on Data Cloud \- Consent Basics**

## **Slide 47: Marketing Cloud Growth & Advanced \- Connect & Unify Data**

This slide illustrates the data flow funnel:

* **A \- DATA STREAMS:** Data sources such as CRM data (Lead, Contact, Account), External Data, Commerce Data. (Connect & Unify)  
* **B \- IDENTITY RESOLUTION RULE:** The filter from the data streams that creates your audience segments (based on configured matching rules). (Connect & Unify)  
* **C \- SEGMENTS:** Creating audiences from all types of data, using attributes to determine your ideal campaign population. (Analyze, Plan & Generate)  
* **D \- UNIFIED INDIVIDUALS:** The filtered individuals that are the population of the segment for your campaign. (Activate)  
* **E \- CONSENT:** Consent lives with the Unified Individual, and is at the channel level (Email, SMS, What'sApp). (Activate)

## **Slide 48: Consent Concepts in Marketing Cloud**

**Understand the key components**

You can collect consent for multiple engagement channels with communication subscriptions.

**Four Objects Store Consent Data:**

1. **Communication Subscription**  
2. **Engagement Channel Type**  
3. **Communication Subscription Channel Type**  
4. **Communication Subscription Consent**

## **Slide 49: Consent Basics \- Unified Individual**

* A **Unified Individual** record consolidates multiple lead or contact records that appear to be the same individual based on Identity Resolution rules that you set.  
* These rules define how a contact point, such as a phone number, is associated with a Unified Individual.

## **Slide 50: Consent Basics \- Contact Point Value**

* Marketing Cloud uses a subset of the Consent Management data model to store consent in Data Cloud.  
* Consent is tied to the **Contact Point Value** (e.g., email or phone), as opposed to the Unified Individual record itself.  
* An Individual Record may have many Contact Points \- email addresses, phone numbers etc.

## **Slide 51: Consent Basics \- Communication Subscription Consent**

* Indicate the Individual that consented, when consent was captured, and through what method.  
* You can also specify if another person consented on behalf of the customer listed in the record.  
* The user's actual consent isn't stored, but rather the action or communication types that the user chooses to subscribe to.  
* **Example:** If two Individuals share the same email address \- if one of them opts-out, this will "unsubscribe" both of them.

## **Slide 52: Consent Basics \- Communication Subscription Channel Type**

* Combination of **Subscription** (newsletter, product updates, voucher promotion) and **Channel Type** (email, phone).  
* Each communication subscription includes at least one channel type, each message (email, SMS) must have a defined Communication Subscription.  
* Communication Subscription Consent status is thus at a subscription and channel level \- you can opt out of a newsletter email but stay opted in to the SMS voucher promotion.

## **Slide 53: Consent Basics \- Communication Subscriptions**

* Each communication subscription requires opt-in.  
* Define additional **Communication Subscriptions** via the Consent Tab in the Marketing App.  
* **Example Subscription:** Marketing (Channels: Email, SMS)

## **Slide 54: Consent Basics \- Levels of Consent**

The consent model is layered:

* **L1 \- Global**  
* **L2 \- Channel Specific** (Email vs SMS, WhatsApp)  
* **L3 \- Subscription Group** (Company News, Product Launch)  
* **L4 \- Subscription** (Newsletter, Compliance Updates, Events, Product News)

**L4 \- Subscription is the Communication Subscription Channel Type**

## **Slide 55: Consent Basics \- Considerations**

* **MCG/A utilizes Level 4 (subscription based)** of consent, which is more flexible for multi-channel and provides explicit consent for each subscription. You're responsible for complying with any laws or regulations that apply to your business.  
* The **Consent Tab in Marketing Cloud** allows you to update the consent status for existing leads and contacts by importing consent data, and manage subscriptions & preference centers.  
* Deleting a communication subscription also deletes all of its related consent data. We recommend that you **don't delete communication subscriptions** after you collect consent data.  
* Consent does not update when Identity Resolution is processing.  
* **Person Accounts are not supported** via the standard data kits and need custom work.

## **Slide 56: Global Consent**

**When MCG/A will require consent validation to send messages**

* Admins can change the consent settings from this page for Email and SMS.  
* Enabled means consent check is necessary on promotional or transactional emails.  
* Direct links included for linking users to Import Data or Manage Subscriptions is in the Consent tab.

**Review Consent Validation:**

* Check the consent for promotional emails.  
* Check the consent for transactional emails.

**PRO TIP\!** All users with 'View Setup' access can see consent settings. Only Administrators are able to modify consent settings.

## **Slide 57: Consent \- Where is it Reflected in MCG/A?**

| Feature | Details |  
| 1\. Global MCG Settings | Company Address, MCG Global Consent Settings (Promotional, Transactional) |  
| 2\. Preferences & Subscriptions | Email Footer: Subscription links. Email for Unified Individuals: Subscription creation by channel. |  
| 3\. Consent Imports | Consent Imports for Unified Individuals. |  
| 4\. User-Managed Consent | Landing Page/Forms/Flow: Update consent based on form fill. Sending Execution: Channel (Email/SMS), Subscription associated for send, Type (Email/SMS), Status (Opt in/Opt-out). |

## **Slide 58: Given These Different Consent Models... What are some functional implications to keep top of mind?**

### **How we gather consent...**

* Form data and imported lists.  
* Explicit consent capture from forms.  
* Ensuing time/date stamping for imported unified individuals.

### **How we migrate consent...**

* **Import/Export:** All data needs to be manually exported (i.e. from MCAE) and Imported into MCG.  
* MCG requires more values than MCAE (time date stamping).

### **Can you migrate back?**

* Given the complexity of the consent model and the data export limitations from MCG for consent data \- **once data is imported, it's a one-way road.**

## **Slide 59: Consent Imports**

**Importing consent**

* Occurs within **Marketing App** (not within CRM UI).  
* Update consent at scale.  
* **Best practice:** use sample import file (to avoid formatting errors).  
* Imports must include phone number or email address and date/timestamp.  
* Consent always stored and updated at **Subscription \+ Channel level** (e.g. 'Newsletter' \+ 'Email').

## **Slide 60: Promotional Email Consent Requirements**

* Add your **Physical Address** and an **Opt-Out Link** to Your Promotional Email.

## **Slide 61: Messaging & Campaigns \- Domain Setup**

## **Slide 62: Domain Setup \- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**

* Before you can send email messages from Marketing Cloud Growth Edition, you must **authenticate a sending domain** that the customer owns.  
* DKIM is an **email authentication method** designed to detect forged sender addresses in email, a technique often used in phishing and email spam.  
* DKIM allows the receiver to check that an email that claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.

4. **Review & Apply.** The new Segment has to be processed before it can be activated.

**Einstein Draft includes:** Suggested Attributes (Object, Attribute, Possible Values) and Reasoning.

## **Slide 87: Generative AI in Marketing Cloud Growth & Adv \- Considerations**

### **Email & SMS**

* When using directly within Content Builder, Einstein will ask for a **Key Message** as initial grounding because briefs are not associated.  
* The **tonality** (i.e., formal or "Conversational Spartan") cannot be adjusted by the customer. In a future release, we plan to make them configurable like Marketing Cloud Engagement.  
* Generative AI doesn't give the user a "finalized" outcome. It's a tool to aid in the creative process, but typically requires humans to adjust prior to finalizing.

### **General**

* Our LLM Gateway service has a **limit of generation per org** for all GPT usage.  
* All prompts will use the **Einstein Trust Layer**.

## **Slide 115: Segments**

* A set of **filtering rules** that are used to identify a target audience.  
* You can build your segments based on **attributes** of available objects such as Account, Contact, or Lead.  
* Segments can be created **manually** (through Segment Builder) or you can use the **Einstein GenAI feature**.  
* Segments are a great way to identify specific customer audiences, allowing you to send more targeted, relevant, or **personalized** messages.

## **Slide 116: How to create an Audience Segment in MCG/A**

| Method | Access Point(s) | Functional Use |  
| 1\. Campaign Members | Campaign Members button, or Contact/Lead tab | Select specific leads or contacts directly to quickly make a group of campaign members. Useful for targeting individuals fast without needing a ruleset. |  
| 2\. Segmentation with Einstein | New Segment (Create with Einstein) | Use natural language to support the criteria you’ve defined to identify relevant audience members. |  
| 3\. Segment Builder | New Segment (Use a Visual Builder) | Apply the segmentation structures within Data Cloud to define audience members based on your explicit criteria / rules. |

## **Slide 117: Adding Campaign Members to a Campaign**

1. Use the **Campaign Members** button within the campaign.  
2. Use the **Campaign Members** section on the Contact or Lead tab.

## **Slide 118: Sending to Campaign Members \- Quickly convert them into a Segment**

* Once you’ve added Campaign Members, you can choose the dropdown next to **Select Segment** and then choose **Send to Campaign Members**.  
* This will automatically convert your group of Campaign Members into a Segment that you can send to.  
* **Note:** If you’ve already associated a Segment with a Campaign Flow, you’ll need to go into that Flow and remove the Segment in order to add your Campaign Members.

## **Slide 119: Sending to Campaign Members \- Key Caveats**

* After generating a Segment, be sure to wait until the Segment fully loads and has a **population size \> 0**.  
* If using the **Send Now** button, be sure to use the re-publish option of ‘**Immediately before running this flow**’. Since your brand new segment hasn’t been published yet, selecting the other option will result in a failure to send.

## **Slide 120: Create a Segment (with Segment Builder)**

You can access segment creation from two places:

1. From the **Segmentation tab**.  
2. Within the **Campaign** (Select Segment \-\> New Segment).

## **Slide 121: Creating a new Segment (Visual Builder)**

* From a Campaign Flow, click on **Select Segment → New Segment** (or from Segments tab, click on New Segment).  
* Select **Use a Visual Builder** and **Standard Segment** and click Next.  
* **Note:** Waterfall Segments and Real-Time Segments are for other Data Cloud use cases, and should not be used for MC Growth & Advanced.

**PRO TIP\!** Depending on account configuration, permissions and provisioned features, this view may look different.

## **Slide 122: Deciding Segment Properties**

* **Segment On the ‘Unified Individual’ object:** You will only be able to activate Email and SMS messaging to a specific segment if it’s built on the Unified Individual.  
* Select the ‘**default**’ Data Space or whichever used to install Data Kits.  
* Give your segment a **Segment Name**.  
* Describe your segment in the **Description** field.  
* Click **Next**.

## **Slide 123: Deciding Segment Properties \- Publishing**

### **Publish Type & Engagement Data Lookback**

* **Standard Publish** (two year lookback window)  
* **Rapid Publish** (last week only lookback)  
* *Standard Publish will take longer and consume more credits.*

### **Publish Schedule**

* Set the cadence for how frequently your segment will auto-refresh.  
  * **Standard:** 12 hrs, 24 hrs, Don’t Refresh  
  * **Rapid:** 1 hrs, 4 hrs, Don’t Refresh  
* **Note:** Setting no refresh cadence (‘Don’t refresh’) may often be appropriate for your segment if you want a static audience.

## **Slide 124: Applying attributes to define your segment**

### **Creating a Specific Audience Using Specific Rules**

* Use the left-hand **Navbar** to search for relevant attributes for your segment.  
* **Drag and drop** the attribute into the main area.

### **Direct vs. Related Attributes**

* **Direct Attributes:** only have a single value (e.g. Birth Date).  
* **Related Attributes:** may have multiple values (e.g. Email Address).

**PRO TIP\!** When setting a related attribute, you’ll also need to include a **measurement count**.

## **Slide 125: Direct vs. Related Attributes \- Examples**

* **Direct Attribute Example:** "I want to send a discount offer to people on their birthday."  
  * Each Unified Individual will have only one Birth Date.  
  * *Result: No measurement is required to set a filter rule.*  
* **Related Attribute Example:** "I want to send an email to people who have (at least one) NTO-domain email address."  
  * Each Unified Individual may have more than one email address.  
  * *Result: A measurement is required to better define the segment.*

## **Slide 126: Navigating Related Attributes**

* In the navigation window on the left, the **bolded text row** represent **Data Model Objects (DMOs)** from your Data Cloud data streams.  
* The plain text rows with the symbol represent all of the attributes of the specific DMO you have already selected in your path.  
* If you ever need to reset your DMO path, simply click the small **home icon** ().

## **Slide 127: Related Attributes & the Data Model Map**

* The **order you click attributes matters\!**  
* When you select related attribute DMOs, you can think of that as moving from node to node along the relationships from your Unified Individual to whatever data object you need.  
* When charting a path for a Segment rule, it is generally advisable to route specifically through DMOs of the ‘**Profile**’ category type (light blue in the Data Model map).

## **Slide 128: Additional Segment Rules (AND/OR Logic)**

This slide illustrates how combining rules creates different audiences:

* **Consumers who have purchased red shoes.** (Implied AND: Purchased shoes AND color is red)  
* **Consumers who purchased shoes of any color AND any red product.** (Explicit AND: (Purchased shoes) AND (Purchased red product))

## **Slide 129: Some Keys to Success**

* The **"Count Population" icon** () can be used at any point to check how many individuals fit your current filter definitions.  
* You can also define rules **positively** ('**Include**') and/or **negatively** ('**Exclude**').  
  * **Positive (Include):** "I want folks with the following attributes to be *included* in my segment."  
  * **Negative (Exclude):** "I want folks with the following attributes to be *excluded* from my segment."

## **Slide 130: Checking segments to maximize confidence**

You can see who is in a Segment via two methods:

1. **Data Cloud Query Editor:** Light SQL snippet required, includes individual’s email address.  
2. **Flow Operational Reporting:** Direct Attributes (e.g. First, Last Name) via a Flow Report.

## **Slide 131: Create with Einstein \- Segmentation (Recap)**

1. Create a new segment and select **Create with Einstein** in the popup dialog.  
2. Confirm you are about to use Einstein.  
3. Create a prompt to let **Agentforce** help you create a new segment.  
4. **Review & Apply.** The new Segment has to be processed before it can be activated.

## **Slide 132: Einstein Segment Creation \- "Human at the helm"**

1. **Count Population:** The number of Unified Individuals the proposed segment applies to.  
2. **Toggle On/Off Specific Attributes:** And remove specific attributes that don’t meet your needs.  
3. **The “Why” Behind AI:** Hover over these icons to see why a specific attribute was included.  
4. **Edit Segment Rules:** Use this output and copy it to the manual Segment Builder.  
5. **Refine Segment:** Give Einstein a new prompt in order to get the exact audience you need.

*When satisfied, simply click ‘Create Segment’.*

## **Slide 133: Segmentation \- Engagement Scoring**

## **Slide 134: Engagement Scoring**

**Contributing to a more defined segment**

Marketing Cloud provides a **default scorecard** to quantify the interest of a lead based on their tracked engagements. Scoring is implemented via Data Cloud **calculated insights**.

### **Considerations:**

* The score can be displayed on the lead, contact, and account records.  
* You can **customize default scoring rules** and decide how engagement and fit scores factor into the overall marketing score for a lead or contact.  
* After you publish scoring rules, records are scored **retroactively** on any relevant data stored in Data Cloud.

## **Slide 135: People Scoring in Marketing Cloud**

*(Slide contains a source reference to a YouTube video on People Scoring)*

## **Slide 136: Engagement Scoring \- Example Setup**

## **Slide 137: Engagement Scoring \- Leveraging Scores in Segments**

Engagement Scores are straightforward to use in a segment, i.e., through the use of the "**Marketing Engagement Score**" tied to the Unified Individual.

## **Slide 138: Flows**

## **Slide 139: Flow for Marketers**

### **DEFINITION...**

Salesforce Flows help you create automated workflows that handle repetitive tasks. They’re used to build personalized customer journeys, trigger actions based on specific criteria, and track the performance of your campaigns.

### **VALUE...**

They help you work smarter, not harder. Flows can be customized to fit your specific needs so you can spend less time on manual work and more time on strategic thinking and creativity.

**PRO TIP\!** Using Flows requires the **Marketing Manager permission set** activated\!

## **Slide 140: Types of Flows | Comparing Apples to Apples**

| Functionality | Segment (Audience) Triggered | Form Triggered |  
| Starting Source | Requires segment | 1:1 relationship with Form |  
| Functional Use | Primarily used to send marketing messages (Email and/or SMS) | Used to map fields and create records based on form submission |  
| How it functions with messaging | Requires segment publish settings to activate | Does not support messaging elements |  
| Flow Uses/Limitations | Supports all flow elements and actions available to user building | Supports all flow elements and actions available to user building (except messaging) |  
| Owner of Flow | Runs in context of the user who activated the flow | |

## **Slide 141: Where can you access Flows?**

* Within **Campaigns** (as a related list).  
* From the main **Flows** tab.
