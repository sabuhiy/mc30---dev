### Solution (Right Side Content)
Style prompting is the brand voice adaptation technique - it maintains brand consistency while adapting tone, vocabulary, and format to maximize engagement on different platforms and with different audiences.

Here's how style prompting works:

**Example Prompt:**
Write a professional LinkedIn post announcing NextMobile's new business fiber service launch. Use a confident, industry-focused tone that emphasizes productivity gains, cost efficiency, and competitive advantages for business decision-makers. Include specific technical benefits and a clear call-to-action for B2B engagement.

**Example Output:**
"🚀 NextMobile Business Fiber is transforming how companies connect and compete. With dedicated 10Gbps speeds, 99.9% uptime SLA, and enterprise-grade security, we're empowering businesses to accelerate growth and innovation. Companies report 40% faster file transfers and seamless video conferencing for teams of any size. Ready to leave slow internet in the past? Let's discuss how fiber can drive your competitive advantage. #BusinessFiber #DigitalTransformation #NextMobile"

**Style Comparison Examples:**
- **LinkedIn Professional**: "NextMobile Business Fiber is transforming how companies connect and compete..."
- **Instagram Casual**: "OMG business owners! 🤯 NextMobile's new fiber is INSANE! 10Gbps = download a movie in 3 seconds ⚡"
- **Email Personal**: "Hi [Name], I wanted to personally share some exciting news about NextMobile's business fiber service..."

**Key Insight:**
Style prompting adapts your message to different audiences and platforms while maintaining core brand values. The same information becomes platform-appropriate through strategic tone, vocabulary, and format adjustments.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Choose NextMobile's unlimited data plan as your message
2. Define two different styles: professional LinkedIn vs casual Instagram
3. Compare how tone and vocabulary changes transform the same business announcement

**Common Pitfalls ❌ :**
**Mixing conflicting styles**: Professional and casual language in the same piece confuses audiences
**Ignoring platform conventions**: Using LinkedIn tone on Instagram reduces engagement
**Generic style instructions**: "Professional tone" is too vague, "confident, industry-focused" is specific

**Pro Tips ✅ :**
**Create platform-specific style guides**: Document tone, vocabulary, and format for each channel
**Test style variations**: Try different approaches to find what resonates with each audience
**Layer style elements**: Combine tone + vocabulary + format for maximum impact
**Maintain brand consistency**: Adapt style while preserving core brand personality
