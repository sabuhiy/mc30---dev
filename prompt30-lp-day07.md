# Day 7 - Control AI Output Format

Welcome to Day 7 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've learned to guide the AI's content and style. Now, let's focus on how the AI presents that information. Output Formatting is a crucial skill for marketers, ensuring that the text you generate is delivered in a structure that fits your needs, whether it's for a presentation, a web page, or a comparison chart.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is launching a cutting-edge fiber internet plan with several standout features. The marketing team needs a standardized way to list these features for various communication channels. Generating this list in a specific, easily transferable format like a markdown bulleted list will save time and reduce manual reformatting.

### Task:

Write a prompt that instructs the AI to list the key features of a high-speed fiber internet plan. Specify that the output must be formatted as a markdown bulleted list. Include features like "Gigabit speeds," "Unlimited data," "Free installation," and "24/7 customer support."

Great job! By specifying the output format, you've ensured the AI delivered the information in a structured, ready-to-use format. This ability to control the presentation of AI-generated text is a powerful tool for efficiency in marketing workflows. Get prepared for Day 8!

### Example Prompt:

List the key features of a high-speed fiber internet plan. Format the output as a markdown bulleted list. Include these features: Gigabit speeds, Unlimited data, Free installation, and 24/7 customer support.

### Example Output:

- Gigabit speeds
- Unlimited data
- Free installation
- 24/7 customer support

This example demonstrates how adding a simple instruction like "Format the output as a markdown bulleted list" directly influences the structure of the AI's response. Instead of a paragraph or a simple comma-separated list, the AI provides a perfectly formatted bulleted list using markdown syntax. This makes it incredibly easy to copy and paste the features into documents, presentations, or web pages without needing significant reformatting. Mastering output formatting allows you to get exactly the structure you need from the AI.
