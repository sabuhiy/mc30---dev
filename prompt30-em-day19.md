Subject: Day 19: Break Down Complexity with Decomposition for NextMobile

Pre-header: Learn how to tackle big tasks by breaking them down in today's challenge!

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 19 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering challenge!

Today, you will learn about Decomposition, a powerful prompt engineering technique for handling complex tasks. Instead of asking the AI to complete a large, multi-faceted request all at once, you break it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems and prompt the AI on each part. This often leads to more accurate and comprehensive results.

Challenge:

The NextMobile marketing team needs a comprehensive content plan for the launch of a new high-speed internet tier. This involves various types of content (website copy, social media posts, email snippets, blog ideas, etc.). Your task is to use Decomposition by first prompting the AI to identify the necessary content types for a product launch and then, in follow-up prompts, asking it to generate specific content ideas or drafts for each type.

Every great adventure starts with a single step. Let the exciting journey of learning Prompt Engineering begin!

Best,

Sabuhi
