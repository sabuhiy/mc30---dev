# Day 13: Experiment with Exemplar Format

Subject: Day 13: Format Is Everything

Pre-header: Discover how the structure and formatting of examples influences AI output format and style.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 13 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

Yesterday you learned how example ordering influences AI behavior and output style. Today, we focus on their format - the way you structure the input and output within your examples can signal to the AI how to interpret information and what kind of output structure you expect.

NextMobile's product documentation team needs to create consistent feature descriptions across their website, but they're struggling with formatting inconsistencies. They have the same content but when they structure the examples differently in their prompts - sometimes as bullet points, sometimes as structured lists, sometimes as conversational descriptions - the AI generates completely different output formats. The web design team needs specific formatting to match their site's style guide, and the team wants to understand how example formatting directly controls AI output structure. Your challenge is to experiment with different formatting styles for your examples and discover how structure signals exactly what kind of output format you want from the AI.

Let's master the art of structure!

Best, Sab

### Challenge Detail
Yesterday you learned how example ordering influences AI behavior and output style. Today, we focus on their format - the way you structure the input and output within your examples can signal to the AI how to interpret information and what kind of output structure you expect.

### Task
Test different formatting styles for your examples and observe how they affect the AI's output structure. Create at least three different format variations and analyze how each influences the AI's response format.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Test card format vs FAQ format vs list format for NextMobile feature descriptions
2. Generate content using each format and test how it imports into your CMS
3. Apply consistent formatting to create a library of product descriptions

**Common Pitfalls:**
❌ **Using generic formatting**: Doesn't consider your specific CMS or style guide needs
❌ **Inconsistent structure across similar content**: Breaks visual consistency
✅ **Match example format to intended output exactly**: Ensures consistent results
✅ **Test formatted examples in your actual publishing system**: Verifies compatibility

**Pro Tips:**
✅ **Match example format to your intended output format exactly**: AI will replicate structure precisely
✅ **Test formatted examples in your actual publishing system**: Ensures compatibility with your tools
✅ **Use consistent formatting across all examples**: Maintains visual consistency
❌ **Don't ignore how formatting appears on different devices**: Consider mobile responsiveness
❌ **Don't use complex formatting that breaks in your CMS**: Keep it compatible with your systems
