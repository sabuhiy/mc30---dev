# Day 24 - Implement Self-Criticism

Welcome to Day 24 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You're refining your skills with techniques like Ensembling and Self-Consistency. Today, we add Self-Criticism to your repertoire. This technique allows you to leverage the AI's ability to analyze and evaluate text, not just generate it. By prompting the AI to critique its own output, you can often get insightful feedback and suggestions for improvement directly from the source.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is launching a new Smart Home Security Sensor â€“ a small but vital part of a home security system. The marketing team needs a short, impactful social media ad to highlight its key benefit (e.g., easy monitoring, peace of mind). You'll use AI to draft an ad, but then you'll use a follow-up prompt to get the AI to act as a critic and suggest how to make that ad even better.

### Task:

Use a two-step prompting process to implement Self-Criticism:

1. Write a prompt asking the AI to generate a short social media ad (e.g., 1-2 sentences) for the new NextMobile Smart Home Security Sensor, focusing on peace of mind.

2. Write a new prompt that includes the AI's generated ad from step 1 and asks the AI to critique the ad and suggest 2-3 specific ways to improve it for clarity, impact, or call to action.

## Solution (Right Side Content)
Great job! By implementing Self-Criticism, you've successfully prompted the AI to evaluate its own work and provide constructive feedback. This technique allows you to refine AI-generated content effectively and iteratively. Get prepared for Day 25!

### Example Prompt 1 (Generate Initial Ad):

Write a short social media ad (1-2 sentences) for the new NextMobile Smart Home Security Sensor, focusing on peace of mind.

### Example Output 1:

Get peace of mind with the new NextMobile Smart Home Security Sensor. Easily monitor your home and stay secure.

### Example Prompt 2 (Critique the Ad):

Here is a social media ad: "Get peace of mind with the new NextMobile Smart Home Security Sensor. Easily monitor your home and stay secure."

Critique this ad and suggest 3 specific ways to improve it for clarity, impact, or call to action.

### Example Output 2:

**Critique and Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Add a stronger hook/benefit:** While "peace of mind" is good, start with a more active or intriguing hook. Suggestion: "Worried about your home? Get instant peace of mind..." or "Know the moment something's amiss."

2. **Strengthen the call to action:** The current ad tells users what the sensor does but doesn't clearly tell them what to do next. Suggestion: Add a phrase like "Learn how it works," "Shop now," or "Get yours today."

3. **Inject more urgency or simplicity:** Make it even punchier for social media. Suggestion: Condense the sentences or use more dynamic language. Example: "Instant peace of mind. Easy home monitoring. Get the new NextMobile Smart Sensor!"

This example demonstrates the power of prompting the AI to critique its own output. In the first step, a basic ad is generated (Example Output 1). In the second step, that ad is provided back to the AI with instructions to critique it (Example Prompt 2). The AI then analyzes the text and provides specific, actionable suggestions for improvement (Example Output 2), such as strengthening the hook, adding a clear call to action, and making it more concise for social media. This self-criticism loop is a highly efficient way to refine marketing copy and ensure it meets your desired standards.
