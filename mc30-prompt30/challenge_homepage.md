## Study Guide

The Prompt30 challenge offers a unique opportunity to enhance your prompt engineering skills by working with real marketing scenarios and AI tools. Unlike other challenges, this program focuses on practical application of prompt engineering techniques in marketing contexts, with hands-on exercises that simulate real-world marketing tasks.

To excel in Prompt30, participants are encouraged to practice each challenge and even create their own scenarios. The more time you dedicate to studying and experimenting with prompts, the better you will grasp prompt engineering concepts. It is recommended to allocate 30-45 minutes for each challenge to fully immerse yourself in the learning experience.

There are several excellent AI platforms available for practicing prompt engineering. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Google's Gemini provide excellent environments for testing and refining your prompts. These platforms allow you to write, test, and iterate on your prompts in real-time.

For the Prompt30 challenges, you will work with NextMobile (a fictional telecommunications company) as your case study. This provides a consistent context for all your learning while covering realistic marketing scenarios including product launches, customer service, social media campaigns, and brand messaging.
