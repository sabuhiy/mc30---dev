### Solution (Right Side Content)
Video Content Optimization is incredibly powerful - it requires platform-specific strategies that account for audience behavior, content format, and engagement patterns unique to each video platform.

Here's how Video Content Optimization works:

**Example Prompt (YouTube):**
Create a 3-minute YouTube explainer video script about NextMobile's fiber internet benefits. Target: homeowners considering internet upgrades. Include hook (0-15 seconds), problem identification (15-60 seconds), solution demonstration (60-150 seconds), and call-to-action (150-180 seconds). Use conversational tone and include visual cues.

**Example Output (YouTube):**
**Hook (0-15 seconds):**
"If you're tired of your family fighting over internet speed, this video will change everything. I'm about to show you how NextMobile fiber eliminates bandwidth battles forever."

**Problem (15-60 seconds):**
"Here's what happens with cable internet: streaming slows down gaming, video calls freeze during important meetings, and everyone blames each other for the slow connection. Sound familiar?"

**Solution (60-150 seconds):**
"NextMobile fiber delivers the same ultra-fast speeds to every device simultaneously. Watch this speed test..."

**Call-to-Action (150-180 seconds):**
"Ready to end your internet frustrations? Click the link below to check if NextMobile fiber is available in your area."

**Example Prompt (TikTok):**
Create a 30-second TikTok video script showing NextMobile's 5G speed. Make it trendy, visual, and shareable with current TikTok trends. Include hook (0-3 seconds), visual demonstration (3-20 seconds), and payoff (20-30 seconds). Use trending audio suggestions and hashtags.

**Example Output (TikTok):**
**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
"POV: You're still waiting for your old internet to load"

**Visual Demo (3-20 seconds):**
*Shows split screen: old internet vs NextMobile 5G*
"Old internet: Still buffering..."
"NextMobile 5G: Already finished downloading"

**Payoff (20-30 seconds):**
"When you upgrade to NextMobile 5G and become that person who never has connection problems"
*Trending audio/music*

**Key Insight:**
Video content prompting requires platform-specific strategies that account for audience behavior, content format, and engagement patterns unique to each video platform to create compelling scripts that feel native to each platform while maintaining brand consistency.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Research platform-specific video content best practices for NextMobile's target platforms
2. Create hooks that grab attention immediately within each platform's optimal timeframe
3. Use platform-native language and current trends in your video content prompts

**Common Pitfalls:**

✅ **Start with strong hooks for each platform**: Grab attention immediately within platform timeframes

**Pro Tips:**
✅ **Use platform-native language and trends**: Makes content feel authentic to each platform
✅ **Include clear visual direction in scripts**: Helps creators understand exactly what to show
✅ **Test content performance and iterate**: Use analytics to improve future video content
❌ **Don't ignore platform-specific features**: Each platform has unique engagement tools to leverage
