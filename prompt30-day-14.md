Subject: Day 14: Organize with Delimiters

Pre-header: Learn to use delimiters to organize prompt sections and improve AI understanding.

Hello [email],

Welcome to Day 14 of the Prompt30 30-day Prompt Engineering Challenge!

Yesterday you learned how example formatting influences AI output structure. Today, we focus on using delimiters - special characters or text that separate different sections of your prompt to help the AI understand where one piece of information ends and another begins.

NextMobile's customer service team is training AI to handle complex customer inquiries that require processing multiple pieces of information - customer details, service history, technical specifications, and billing information. When they put all this information in one long prompt, the AI gets confused and mixes up different types of data. The team needs a way to clearly separate different sections of information so the AI can understand what each piece is for and respond appropriately to multi-part customer service scenarios.

Let's organize for clarity!

Best, Sab

### Challenge Detail
Yesterday you learned how example formatting influences AI output structure. Today, we focus on using delimiters - special characters or text that separate different sections of your prompt to help the AI understand where one piece of information ends and another begins.

### Task
Create a customer service prompt using delimiters to separate different types of information. Test how delimiters improve AI understanding of complex, multi-part customer service scenarios.

### Resources

### Solution (Right Side Content)
Delimiter Organization is incredibly powerful - it transforms complex customer service scenarios into clearly structured, processable information that AI can understand and respond to accurately.

Here's how Delimiter Organization works:

**Example Prompt:**
Handle this NextMobile customer service inquiry:

===CUSTOMER INFO===
Name: Sarah Johnson
Account: Premium Fiber Plan
Location: Downtown District
Account Status: Active, 2 years

===SERVICE ISSUE===
Internet speeds dropping to 50Mbps during peak hours
Affecting video conferences and streaming
Started 3 days ago

===TECHNICAL DETAILS===
Modem: NextMobile FiberMax Pro
Router: Customer-owned Netgear
Signal strength: -65dBm
Last service check: 6 months ago

===CUSTOMER REQUEST===
Wants immediate resolution
Considering switching providers
Needs solution by tomorrow

Create a comprehensive service response.

**Example Output:**
Hi Sarah,

I understand your frustration with the speed drops during peak hours, especially with your video conferences being affected. Here's your immediate action plan:

**Immediate Steps (Today):**
- Scheduling priority technician visit for tomorrow morning
- Upgrading your area's network capacity this week
- Providing temporary mobile hotspot for backup

**Technical Resolution:**
Your signal strength suggests infrastructure optimization needed. Our technician will check your fiber connection and optimize settings for your customer router.

**Account Protection:**
As a 2-year Premium customer, I'm adding 1 month service credit and priority support status to your account.

**Timeline:**
- Tomorrow: Technician visit (8-10 AM)
- This week: Network capacity upgrade
- Follow-up: Service quality check in 3 days

**Key Insight:**
Delimiters transform complex customer service scenarios into organized, processable information that AI can understand and respond to accurately, reducing confusion and improving response quality for multi-part customer interactions.

**Try This Yourself:**
1. Create customer service prompts with clear sections using delimiters
2. Test different delimiter styles (===, ---, ###) for NextMobile scenarios
3. Compare organized vs unorganized prompt performance

**Common Pitfalls:**
❌ **Using unclear or inconsistent delimiters**: Confuses AI rather than helping
❌ **Too many sections that overwhelm**: More sections isn't always better
✅ **Use consistent delimiters throughout your prompt**: Maintains clear organization
✅ **Label each section clearly**: Makes purpose obvious to AI

**Pro Tips:**
✅ **Use consistent delimiters throughout your prompt**: Maintains clear organization structure
✅ **Label each section clearly**: Makes the purpose obvious to AI processing
✅ **Keep sections focused and relevant**: Don't create unnecessary divisions
❌ **Don't mix different delimiter styles in the same prompt**: Stick to one style
❌ **Don't over-segment simple information**: Use delimiters when complexity requires it
