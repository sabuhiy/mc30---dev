# Day 6 - Define Your AI's Style

Welcome to Day 6 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've learned to assign roles to influence AI output. Today, we refine that control even further with Style Prompting. This technique allows you to dictate the specific tone, voice, or style of the AI's generated text, ensuring it perfectly matches your brand's identity and the nuances required for different marketing channels and audiences.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is about to drop the "NextMobile Pulse," a new smartphone designed with Gen Z in mind. The social media buzz needs to be authentic, high-energy, and speak their language. Generic marketing speak won't cut it. Your challenge is to use Style Prompting to guide the AI in creating a social media announcement that sounds like it came straight from their feed â€“ exciting, informal, and full of energy.

### Task:

Write a prompt that uses Style Prompting to generate a social media post announcing the NextMobile Pulse. Instruct the AI to adopt an energetic, informal, and modern tone suitable for a young audience.

This example demonstrates how specifying the desired style ("energetic, informal, and modern") and target audience ("young audience") directly influenced the AI's output. The language includes slang ("level up," "dropped," "pop"), emojis, and hashtags commonly used on social media platforms favored by a younger demographic. By clearly defining the style in your prompt, you can ensure the AI generates content that feels authentic and engaging for your intended readers.
