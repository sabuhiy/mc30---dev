# Day 21 - Implement Program-of-Thoughts

Welcome to Day 21 of the NextMobile Prompt Engineering Challenge!

You've learned to break down problems and reason step-by-step. Today, we introduce Program-of-Thoughts, a technique that formalizes this reasoning into structured steps, much like a simple program. This is incredibly powerful for tasks that involve calculations, data processing, or require a clear, verifiable sequence of logical operations.

## Challenge Description
NextMobile is promoting a new unlimited data plan, and a key selling point is the potential cost savings for customers who currently pay overage charges or are on tiered plans. To effectively communicate these savings in marketing materials (like a savings calculator explainer or a detailed FAQ), you need the AI to outline the calculation process clearly. Your challenge is to use a Program-of-Thoughts approach to get the AI to generate these calculation steps.

### Task:

Write a prompt using a Program-of-Thoughts approach to outline the steps for calculating the potential monthly cost savings for a NextMobile customer switching from a tiered data plan to a new unlimited data plan. The calculation should consider their current plan cost, current data usage, the cost of data overages (if applicable on the old plan), and the cost of the new unlimited plan.

## Solution (Right Side Content)
Great job! By using a Program-of-Thoughts approach, you've successfully prompted the AI to generate a structured, logical sequence for a calculation. This makes the AI's process transparent and provides you with clear steps that can be used in customer-facing content or internal tools. Get prepared for Day 22!

### Example Prompt:

Outline the steps to calculate the potential monthly cost savings for a customer switching from a tiered data plan to a NextMobile unlimited data plan. Present the steps like a simple program or logical sequence.

### Example Output:

Here are the steps to calculate potential monthly cost savings:

1. **Get Current Plan Details:** Identify the customer's current tiered plan monthly cost and their typical monthly data usage (in GB).

2. **Check for Overage Costs:** Determine if the customer typically exceeds their tiered plan's data limit. If yes, calculate the average monthly cost of data overages based on their usage and the overage rate per GB on their current plan.

3. **Calculate Total Current Cost:** Add the current tiered plan monthly cost and the average monthly data overage cost (if any) to get the total typical monthly spending on the current plan.

4. **Get New Plan Cost:** Identify the monthly cost of the new NextMobile unlimited data plan.

5. **Calculate Monthly Savings:** Subtract the cost of the new unlimited plan from the total typical monthly spending on the current plan.

6. **Display Savings:** The result is the potential monthly cost savings.

This example demonstrates how the instruction to "Present the steps like a simple program or logical sequence" guided the AI to output a numbered list of clear, sequential steps for the calculation. Each step is a distinct action, similar to a line in a program or an instruction in an algorithm. This structured output is easy to follow, verify, and translate into explanatory content for NextMobile customers, helping them understand exactly how potential savings are calculated. Program-of-Thoughts is excellent for tasks requiring logical precision and transparency in the AI's process.
